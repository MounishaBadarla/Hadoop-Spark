# Hadoop-Spark Project
### This aim of this project is to Design and Develop Big data solutions for the weather data of 10 years.
The unstructured data is processed by using techniques like map reduce and the resultant structured data is analysed and insights are drawn from it.
## Firstly Unstructured weather data from the hadoop cluster is extracted using putty, Queries are run using pyspark.
## Few of the insights that are drawn from the data are given below
### 1. The hottest and coldest day along the station code and date for each year from 2010 to 2019.
### 2. The hottest and coldest day across all years (2010 - 2019) along with station code and date.
### 3. Maximum and minimum precipitation with station code and date for year 2015.
### 4. Count percentage missing values for mean station pressure (STP) for year 2019 and stations.
### 5. Station code with maximum wind gust and date for year 2019 
### With this information it is evident that any other parameters can be drawn from the given data for any year from 2010-201
